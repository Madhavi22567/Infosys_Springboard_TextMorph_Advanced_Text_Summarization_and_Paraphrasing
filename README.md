# Infosys_Springboard_TextMorph_Advanced_Text_Summarization_and_Paraphrasing
MY INFOSYS PROJECT 
TextMorph is an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) project developed under the Infosys Springboard initiative, focusing on intelligent Text Summarization and Paraphrasing using modern Transformer-based architectures.

This repository presents a comprehensive implementation of both Abstractive and Extractive Text Summarization techniques, along with a semantic-aware Paraphrasing system, designed to condense and rephrase large volumes of text while preserving contextual meaning and key information.
